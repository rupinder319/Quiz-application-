Developing quiz application by using Django
It is a quiz application which is created by using Django and Python.
Firstly when it runs on browser we can see its home page where we see navbar which contains link to registration, login and result page and it also has footer which contains information about company which created application.
It uses Django authentication, authorization features and already existing forms.
It allows user to do registration and stores that data in Django User table which already exists in Django.
It uses validation feature of Django for successful login of user.
After successful login it allows user to take quiz.
Everytime when we start quiz it show us random questions.
After completing quiz it show user the final result of quiz as well as  past result and highest and lowest grades of all quizes which user completed.
If user grades are less than 50% then it allows user to take quiz again.
In this way front-end is connected with back-end.
